1.) Better pathing - Implemented A*, now have units follow path. This includes
	formations and flocking and good stuff like that. Also need smarter
	path weighting in terms of fields of fire, strength of position, etc.
2.) Targeting cursor
3.) More Units
XXX 10/29/2005 4.) Notion of teams, me against you, multinational forces
5.) User controlled vs computer controlled enemies/allies
6.) Need a model for unit state changes and decision making
7.) team formations (spread, fan, cover, etc)
XXX 10/19/2005 8.) Add units to elements/tiles
9.) Speed up rendering. Remove all the widget allocations and things like that,
    dirty rectangle rendering, etc
10.) Moving the marks/defense/ambush circles
11.) Implement defend, ambush, smoke, etc
XXX 10/25/2005 12.) Houses and roofs
13.) Non-shimmering texture transformations
14.) Fix entity character references in character parsing in XML parsers
15.) Optimize A*. It is really slow right now on long paths/unreachable paths.
     It also has a bug on longer paths.
16.) Use a pathing queue to spread pathfinding out over several cycles
17.) Implement a LOS cache to speed up LOS calculations
18.) Better memory management in general. I want a way to check
	 total allocated memory, freed memory, etc. Also remove all the per-cycle
	 allocations, for such things a widgets and graphics, etc.
19.) Fixed memory allocators in A* for Path and Node structures
20.) Use a path stack for individual soldier pathfinding
21.) Vehicles need to follow paths
22.) Only load graphics as needed
23.) Now that objects have been added to tiles, make sure all checking
	 uses this new facility rather than iterating over all objects.
24.) Some elements like doors and windows and stuff need to fix their blocking
	 values, blocking height, block all, stuff like that.
