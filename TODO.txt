1.) Better pathing - Implemented A*, now have units follow path
2.) Targeting cursor
3.) Units
4.) Notion of teams, me against you, multinational forces
5.) User controlled vs computer controlled enemies/allies
6.) Need a model for unit state changes and decision making
7.) team formations (spread, fan, cover, etc)
8.) Add units to elements/tiles
9.) Speed up rendering. Remove all the widget allocations and things like that,
    dirty rectangle rendering, etc
10.) Moving the marks/defense/ambush circles
11.) Implement defend, ambush, smoke, etc
12.) Houses and roofs
13.) Non-shimmering texture transformations
14.) Fix entity character references in character parsing in XML parsers
15.) Optimize A*. It is really slow righ now on long paths/unreachable paths
16.) Use a pathing queue to spread pathfinding out over several cycles
17.) Implement a LOS cache to speed up LOS calculations
18.) Better memory management in general. I want a way to check
	 total allocated memory, freed memory, etc. Also remove all the per-cycle
	 allocations, for such things a widgets and graphics, etc.
19.) Fixed memory allocators in A* for Path and Node structures
20.) Use a path stack for individual soldier pathfinding
21.) Vehicles need to follow paths
